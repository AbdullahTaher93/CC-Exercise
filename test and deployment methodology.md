test and deployment methodology
Testing: it’s one of those potentially dull and yet highly contentious topics. I’ll try to avoid the dull, but there may be some contention brewing on the horizon.

Most programmers work on software that others have created and that others will develop after them. Sharing the code creates a community in which the team of developers live and interact. Preserving code quality not only has a direct impact on how well a developer can do their job, it becomes a moral obligation to their colleagues in the community.

Add to this the responsibility to deliver quality to the paying customer, the direct relationship between app uptime and revenue, plus the difficulty of testing in a complex web ecosystem, and it’s easy to see why web developers have a love/hate relationship with testing.

What to test
Web app tests fall into five main categories:

Functional tests: does the app work?
Compatibility tests: does the app work consistently for everyone?
Performance tests: does the app respond quickly and how does traffic affect performance?
Security tests: is the app secure against attacks?
Usability tests: is the app easy to use and does it respond to interaction as expected?
All these tests add up to a lot of time, but do you really need them all? As usual, it depends. Let common sense prevail. If your app is used in a hospital to prescribe medication doses, or it’s a critical financial component in a large enterprise, don’t skimp on the tests. On the other hand, I suspect that most of you are building a spanking new web app that doesn’t impact human safety or hundreds of jobs. The critical thing to remember for new ideas is that your app will probably change.[read more....](http://webappsuccess.com/testing-and-deployment.html)
